# PipeBit ðŸ›¸

PipeBit is a Quick Pipeline Deployment System for Local Data Pipelines based on Multi-Threading in Python without having to reference any pipeline paths.

How to Install PipeBit
==========

*Requirements: 
- Python 3.6+ installed.

Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed and run the following command in your terminal to install PipeBit:

For MacOS and GNU/Linux:

```python
pip3 install pipebit
```

For Windows:

```python
pip install pipebit
```

How to Run PipeBit
==========

PipeBit works on a Sender / Receiver model using Lists for both cases. Currently, PipeBit supports one Pipeline Model: **BitPack**. This Model allows to transfer a data packet with a predetermined packet size that refreshes the pipeline buffer every time a new packet is sent. 

PipeBit can be used as a Multi-Pipeline system, having one Sender serving data over a specific Pipeline and having multiple Receivers extracting data from such Pipeline, allowing to create interesting data  transfer architectures.

## BitPackSender

**BitPackSender(name: str, size: int, override: boolean)**

This is the Object that creates the pipeline and takes in 3 parameters: the name the pipeline will have, the size for the packet of data it will transfer, and its override option. This last option is a Boolean that can be set to True in the case that if the pipeline already exists, we override it (change size and clean its previous buffer value). If set to False it will keep its previous buffer value until changed.

**send(data: List)**

This method releases a single thread that sends a List of the specified size of the packet.

**open_connection()**

Opens connection with the Pipeline.

**close_connection()**

Closes connection with the Pipeline.

## BitPackReceiver

**BitPackReceiver(name: str)**

This Object only takes 1 parameter which is the name of the pipeline that is assumed to have already been created by a BitPackSender in the past. No need to specify anything more, if the pipeline exists it will link it automatically. The Receiver Object works on a Multi-Thread Model, so it will begin to cache the incoming data from the pipeline since its declaration inside its packet cache memory.

**receive()**

This method of the object retrieves the data from the packet cache memory and returns it as a List of Lists, where each of these Lists represents the packet that was sent over the pipeline.

**open_connection()**

Opens connection with the Pipeline.

**close_connection()**

Closes connection with the Pipeline.

Sender / Receiver Example
==========

For this example create two Python Files: **sender.py** and **receiver.py** and place them wherever you want, they don't need to be in the same directory nor anything. Here we use the **time** library to make the process a little slower so it can be visible, but there is no need to use it. We also check if the data received is not empty so we can display it.

It is recommended to use the **time** library if you pretend to send big amounts of data sequentially as in a While (True) statement so the Queue of Packets to be sent does not become too big and consume too much memory. For instance, you could use time.sleep(0.1) and it would work just fine.

Run both files parallelly, but first run the **sender.py** file so it creates the Pipeline (it will run in about 15 seconds to finish the for loop, run the other file before this time so you can appreciate the result) and then run the **receiver.py** file so it can extract the data coming from the Pipeline.

The content of the files is the following:

- sender.py

```python
import pipebit
import time

# Defines Sender that creates a Pipeline with name 'data_pipe', size 5 and no Override
sender = pipebit.BitPackSender("data_pipe",5,False)

# Opens Sender Connection with the Pipeline
sender.open_connection()

# Iterates from 0 to 29 and sends the values from i, i + 1 ... i + 4 (size of 5), having an interruption interval between each of half a second
for i in range(30):
    sender.send([i,i+1,i+2,i+3,i+4])
    time.sleep(0.5)
    
# Closes Sender Connection with the Pipeline
sender.close_connection()
```

- receiver.py

```python
import pipebit

# Defines Receiver that connects with the Pipeline named 'data_pipe'
receiver = pipebit.BitPackReceiver("data_pipe")

# Opens Receiver Connection with the Pipeline
receiver.open_connection()

# Infinite Loop that listens for incoming data from the pipeline and prints it out to the console excepting an empty data value
while(True):
    data = receiver.receive()
    if(len(data)):
        print(data)
        
# Closes Receiver Connection with the Pipeline (Unreachable)
receiver.close_connection()
```

Here is another example of **sender.py** using Tkinter to send the amount of times a Button is pressed, using the same **receiver.py** file as before and the same pipeline:

```python
from tkinter import *
import pipebit

# Define iterator starting at 1
i = 1

# Sends the Data to the Pipeline everytime the Button is pressed
def pressed_button(event):
    global i
    sender.open_connection()
    sender.send(["Pressed the button {0} times!".format(i)])
    i += 1
    sender.close_connection()  

# Create Button
widget = Button(None, text = "Send Data")
widget.pack()
widget.bind('<Button-1>', pressed_button)

# Create Clicks Pipeline
sender = pipebit.BitPackSender("data_pipe",1,True)

# Tkinter Mainloop
widget.mainloop()
```
